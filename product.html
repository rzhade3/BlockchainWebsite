								<h3>Jericho</h3>
								<p>Our team has developed, and is in the process of commercializing, a novel solution to integrate blockchain into mission-critical information driven defense and intelligence systems utilizing a synthesis of hardware and software. Most of the challenges regarding integrating blockchain technology into defense systems stem from using the costly and electrically straining Proof-of-Work (POW) consensus algorithm. Instead, we have chosen to build our blockchain platform off a recent breakthrough from Intel, codenamed Sawtooth Lake. Sawtooth abstracts the core concepts of consensus and isolates consensus from transaction semantics. Instead of POW, Sawtooth Lake utilizes a combination of new secure CPU instructions and protected on-board CPU memory. We combine this with an innovative consensus algorithm- Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET). PoET works as follows; every validator requests a wait time from an enclave, protected DRAM directly on the CPU die that is securely encrypted with SHA-512, and the validator with the shortest wait time for a transaction block is elected the leader. One function, say “CreateTimer” creates a timer for a transaction block that is guaranteed to have been created by the enclave. Another function, say “CheckTimer” verifies that the timer was created by the enclave and, if it has expired, creates an attestation that can be used to verify that validator did, in fact, wait the allotted time before claiming the leadership role. 

<p>The PoET leader election algorithm meets the criteria for a good lottery algorithm. It randomly distributes leadership election across the entire population of validators with distribution that is similar to what is provided by other lottery algorithms. The probability of election is proportional to the resources contributed (in this case, resources are general purpose processors with a trusted execution environment). An attestation of execution provides information for verifying that the certificate was created within the enclave (and that the validator waited the allotted time). Further, the low cost of participation increases the likelihood that the population of validators will be large, increasing the robustness of the consensus algorithm. By utilizing the breakthrough CPU enclave architecture interface developed at Intel, combined with a PoET consensus algorithm, a highly efficient, secure, and truly distributed blockchain can be developed avoiding latency, power, and computational constraints; and that model is Jericho. </p>

								<h4>Background on Blockchain</h4>
								<p>Blockchain is an existing cryptographic network protocol, most commonly used to secure Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions. Blockchain functions as a publicly distributed ledger that displays a list of all the transactions/data submissions that ever occurred the network. Each user’s device verifies the authenticity of the blockchain through pre-programmed consensus algorithms and any adversary who has tampered with the information in the network will be automatically detected, denied future access, and the correct list of transactions/data submissions will remain intact. Blockchain network architectures yield a variety of advantages. First, blockchain networks are trustless; they assume compromise of the network by both insiders and outsiders, inverting the cyber security paradigm thus reducing an insider “Snowden” style threat. Second, blockchains are transparently secure; they do not rely on failure-prone secrets, passwords, or administrative privileges (like the ones that Snowden abused); instead, the blockchain relies on a cryptographic data structure that makes tampering both exceptionally difficult and immediately obvious. (ex. Disgruntled employee cannot delete data or external adversary couldn’t alter the data) Next, blockchains networks are fault tolerant; they align the efforts of honest nodes to reject those that are dishonest, using the asymmetry of the majority of honest nodes to reject the minority of dishonest ones making for a far more resilient network. As a result, blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it (an adversary would need to gain control over a majority of the nodes in the network to overcome the consensus algorithm and do any damage). Finally, by eliminating the central server architecture and implementing inherent cryptographic security, the network infrastructure is greatly simplified and reduces cost.</p>

								<p>Algorithms for achieving consensus with arbitrary faults generally require some form of voting among a known set of participants. The most popular, often referred to as “Nakamoto consensus”, also known as Proof-of-Work (POW), elects a leader through some form of “lottery”. The leader then proposes a block that can be added to a chain of previously committed blocks. In Bitcoin (POW), the first participant to successfully solve a cryptographic puzzle wins the leader-election lottery. To solve this “puzzle” each node in the network tries to create a new hash based off the hashes of the previous blocks in the chain that meets certain requirements (for example, a hash with 13 leading zeros); computers attempt to solve this problem essentially by guessing a combination of multiple different hashes until they produce one that meets the specified requirements, and the computer that successfully solves the puzzle becomes the elected leader. The leader then broadcasts the new block to the rest of the participants who implicitly vote to accept the block by adding the block to a chain of accepted blocks and proposing subsequent transaction blocks that build on that chain through the same process which becomes more and more complex (and secure) the longer the chain grows. The primary challenge with integrating blockchain technology into defense systems, or indeed any enterprise system, lies within the constraints of this Proof-of-Work consensus architecture; to achieve an efficient blockchain network with POW, a large amount of computational power (and thus electricity and space) is necessary or else the latency of the network would render it unusable. Additionally, a significant amount of heat is produced from the intense hashing performed by CPUs and GPUs, resulting in unwieldy cooling systems. For many defense applications, these restraints make implementation far too costly or simply infeasible.</p>
